This is our summer hiking plan.  Example using GitHub Desktop.

It's either a hiking plan, or alteratively we could just not exercise and instead order pizza.

# update
Where should we go hiking?
Lansing thinks we should go to Texas.  Texas forever, Jason Street, amirite?  
Although, Vermont has good ice cream.  

# update 2
Vermont sometimes floods though.  Texas rarely floods.  If anything it gets frozen over.  Hah.

# update 3 (from Github.com)
You can even edit files in the browser (but gah, that's mildly bad methinks).

# update 4 (from VS Code)
How long of a hike should we do?  Alternatively, how large of a pizza should we order?
