This is our summer hiking plan.  Example using GitHub Desktop.

It's either a hiking plan, or alteratively we could just not exercise and instead order pizza.

# update
Where should we go hiking?
Lansing thinks we should go to Texas.  Texas forever, Jason Street, amirite?  
Although, Vermont has good ice cream.  

# update 2
Vermont sometimes floods though.  Texas rarely floods.  If anything it gets frozen over.  Hah.
